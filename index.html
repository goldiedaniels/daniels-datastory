      <p> Hi I’m Goldie Daniels, I’m a junior Literature and Language major at VT. I’m also attempting a minor in Psychology and Horticulture because I love both of those subjects intensely. This semester, I created a study to look at how I conveyed and perceived emotions on a platform that I used daily and that didn’t originally lend itself to expressing emotions – through texting. Texting has evolved as a method of communication to include pictures, videos, audio messages, and even emojis. These small, expressive symbols can be easily interpreted by someone like me, who is extremely empathetic and is an overall highly emotional person. I knew that I used emojis a lot, but who else in my life did? Did they use them as often as I did? Why did I choose to use this emoji over another?

      <p> To answer these questions, I created a bubble chart to categorize the emojis I sent and received into certain emotion categories. The data was also sorted by who sent me the text or who I sent the text to, by general colors of groups. It’s also important to note that the size of the bubbles is a comparative measure of how many texts I received from that person who was expressing a certain emotion. In most cases, a bubble is divided in a pie chart to show that more than one emoji could be used to express an idea or emotion. This graph shows who texts me the most with emojis, which is my mom. This could be due to the fact that she texts me the most (with a goodmorning/goodnight text every day) or that she is similarly an empathetic and expressive person like myself. I also noticed that almost every person sent me a text including an “Amused” emoji, which to me means that I’m a good person to laugh with, or I surround myself with largely funny and positive people. Due to the sheer number of pie slices, it’s obvious that multiple emojis can be used to express a single emoji, but there are certainly some that are more popular than others.

      <p> I also created a video in which I talk about Private and Public collection and uses of data by certain service providers, such as Verizon and AT&T. I text and call every single day, and with every text I sent, I was unknowingly letting Verizon collect and store my data. My obliviousness was most likely due to the fact that my parents were the ones that had set me up with my provider, and that I haven’t really seen the terms and conditions or the privacy policy, let alone look through them thoroughly. This is a prevalent problem in a world that craves instant gratification, and often doesn’t take the time to read the terms and conditions of something as seemingly harmless as a service provider. The fix: if you’re concerned about what information is stored and shared by a service provider, check the privacy policy statement located on their websites. Some often offer an “opt-out” procedure that lets you remove yourself from the list of those the provider can collect certain data from.

    <div> The semester was certainly a struggle. I hadn’t ever worked with Inkscape to make an SVG before. I had made a website either, and the last time I made a video with iMovie was in 7th grade. You could say I was completely lost during these projects. Although these projects were all difficult technically, they were incredibly interesting and pushed me to work with my classmates to learn the basics of each project, and to get feedback from them. Every classmate I talked to and made friends with seemed to have a piece of the puzzle that would help me finish my project, piece by piece. In turn, I was able to offer some advice to my peers to help them along, even meeting outside of class to have a dinner and create a single-page website. This was a difficult journey, but my peers were there to help me along the way, and commiserate when my morale was low.
